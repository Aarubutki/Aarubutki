 1. New methodological improvements to RLHF or instruction-following which are specific fine-tuning steps that are taken to make language models better at following user instructions across a range of tasks.
    - Relevant: papers that discuss specific methods like RLHF, or instruction-tuning datasets, improving these methods, or analyzing them.
    - Not relevant: papers about adaptation to some task. Simply following instructions or inputs are not sufficient.
 2. Shows new powerful test set contamination or membership inference methods for language models. Test set contamination is the phenomenon where a language model observes a benchmark dataset during pretraining.
    - Relevant: test statistics that can detect contamination of benchmarks in language models. statistics that can provide guarantees are more interesting. membership inference methods that are general enough to apply to language models are also relevant.
    - Not relevant: any papers that do not consider language models, or that do not consider test set contamination.
 3. Shows a significant advance in the performance of diffusion language models.
    - Relevant: papers that study language models that are also diffusion models. Continuous diffusions are even more relevant, while discrete diffusions are less so.
    - Not relevant: papers about image d
